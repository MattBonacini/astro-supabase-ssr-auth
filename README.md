# Astro + Supabase SSR Auth

Minimal starter boilerplate to use Astro with Supabase SSR with auth that actually works. While I'm publishing this repo, Supabase docs for Astro are recommending a broken setup with deprecated code. In my case, despite I followed Supabase docs as much as possible, users were also getting logged out multiple times per day.

This starter solves these problems. I found several discussions with Supabase users that experienced the same issues, and I hope this can help you save some hours of work with your next Astro & Supabase project.

## ‚≠ê Main Features

- Node
- Supabase SSR
- Supabase Auth with PKCE flow
- Tailwind 4 + DaisyUI 5

## ‚ö° How to use:

### In Astro

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Edit .env.sample with the correct information of your Supabase project (or install if you self host Supabase), then rename it to .env
4. Run `npm run dev`

### In Supabase

1. Make sure your users are allowed to sign up on your Supabase DB. If you self host, you need to set the env variable: GOTRUE_DISABLE_SIGNUP to false.
2. You must add the redirect URL to the redirect allow list of Supabase. If you self host, you need to add it to the project's env variable: GOTRUE_URI_ALLOW_LIST. You can add "http://localhost:4321/**,https://yourlivedomain.com/**" or something more precise. The URL that needs this permission is the one we set in `src\pages\api\auth\signin.ts`.
3. In Supabase, you must also specify other information depending on the providers you plan to use for Oauth. This is slightly easier in Supabase cloud ([link to the docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login)). For self-hosted Supabase, you need to specify the required data with env variables. You can find a [complete list of these variables here](https://github.com/supabase/auth/blob/master/example.env). They all start with "GOTRUE_EXTERNAL". Here are the ones necessary for allowing users to login with LinkedIn:

```text
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_LINKEDIN_OIDC_ENABLED=true
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_LINKEDIN_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=client_id_from_linkedin_app
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_LINKEDIN_OIDC_SECRET=client_secret_from_linkedin_app
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_LINKEDIN_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI=https://yoursupabaseaddress.com/auth/v1/
```

### üóÑÔ∏è How to use Supabase client in the codebase

I recommend reading the comments in `src\lib\supabase.ts` to understand how to use Supabase SSR client in your codebase.

## üöÄ Project Structure

You will notice that the sign out is handled with an Astro action while Register and Sign In are handled by Astro API Endpoints. This is done on purpose to show you two different approaches, so you can choose your favorite and edit the code base according to your needs.

Astro actions are server side and should be added to the `src/actions/` directory.

API endpoints are in the `src/pages/api/` directory.

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## üßû Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
